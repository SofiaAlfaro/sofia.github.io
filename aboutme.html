        <h1>A Bit About Sofia</h1>
        <div id= "aboutmecss">
            <p> My full name is Sofia Paul Angelica Alfaro Carranza. My parents were born in El Salvador but I was born in Washington Heights, Manhattan. My birthday is February 7, 2002 and I am currently 16 years old. I go to Cristo Rey New York Highschool and participate in extracurricular activites such as choir and GSA. So far I've had two jobs, Mount Sinai Hospital and First Republic Bank, thanks to my highschool. My interests include anything that allows me to be creative, including art, singing, acting, and writing. I consider myself to be hard-working and adaptable.</p>
